            <p>A project built around decision making through linked files.</p>
            <p>This project was about creating a story through linked files based on what decisions you made throughout the story.</p>
            <p>Me and my partner, Anna made our adventure based on murder mystery. Our teacher assigned us this project to practice our Command Line skills, but more importantly this was assigned to us so we could practice our communication skills, and to practice out collaboration skills with each other. This is so we can practice working with people we don't know later on, since we don't always get to choose who we work with in the real world.Some challenges that we had faced early on in our project was a lack of communication on slack. Since we didn't get to communicate much when we did the project it would look strange to the other person the next day. It didn't help that it was a little difficult to understand our plan. We overcame this problem by trying to communicate with each other in a much easier way than slack. This was much better for us to communicate as we could now properly talk about what we were doing and there wouldn't be as much confusion between the two of us. This helped us with better communication, as well as much better collaboration between each other.Had there been more time, I would've changed how our original plan looked, so that instead of having to take so much time debating between our project, we could've just had one neat project that would've saved us lots of time, and possibly even allowed us to add more things to our project.</p>
